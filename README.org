#+title: Klojure

Note: This README is yet to evolve.

* Purpose
The purpose of this library is to reduce friction (as a low bar) in using Clojure in your Kotlin codebases.
A a higher bar, the purpose is to make it enjoyable to use Clojure in your Kotlin codebases

* Rationale
The purpose of Kotlin is to make Java enjoyable. While Kotlin has adopted many developer-friendly ideas from multiple languages, there are times when you miss the fluidity (or functionality) available in the Clojure world. Especially if you are a Clojure fan but constrained to work in a Kotlin codebase.

The pitch to the *management* is that this is _just another Kotlin library_. And we limit Clojure code to a specific set of purposes and label them as DSL. ;-)
